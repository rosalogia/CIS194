# CIS194 Exercise Files

This is a repository of some of the code I wrote to complete exercises for [this Haskell course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall16/index.html).
Not all of my exercises will be committed, just the ones that I felt I worked hardest on and found the most interesting. Please consider checking out
the course linked! It's very interesting, challenging and formative. If you have never engaged with functional programming before, it will definitely
change the way you think and approach problems.
